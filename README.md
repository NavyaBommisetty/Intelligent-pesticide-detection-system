## Overview

This project addresses the critical challenge of inefficient pesticide application in agriculture. Traditional methods apply chemicals uniformly across entire fields, wasting 60-80% on healthy plants and causing environmental harm. Our system uses computer vision and thermal imaging to detect plant diseases at early stages and recommend targeted pesticide application.
**Challenge**: Intelligent Pesticide Sprinkling System Determined by the Infection Level of a Plant

## Problem Statement

Modern agriculture faces significant challenges:

- **Resource Waste**: 60-80% of pesticides are applied unnecessarily on healthy plant areas
- **Late Detection**: Visual symptoms appear 3-5 days after infection begins
- **Environmental Impact**: Excessive chemical use pollutes soil and water
- **Economic Loss**: Farmers spend ‚Çπ5,000-8,000 per acre on pesticides with poor targeting
- **Manual Inspection**: Time-consuming and prone to human error

**The Need**: An intelligent, automated system that detects diseases early and applies pesticides only where needed.

##  Solution

Our **Smart Pesticide Detection System** employs a multi-modal approach combining visual and thermal analysis:

### System Workflow

```
Input Image ‚Üí Preprocessing ‚Üí Disease Detection ‚Üí Thermal Analysis ‚Üí Severity Calculation ‚Üí Pesticide Recommendation
```

### How It Works

1. **Image Acquisition**: Capture RGB and thermal images of plant leaves
2. **Preprocessing**: Enhance image quality and remove noise
3. **Disease Detection**: Identify infected spots using computer vision algorithms
4. **Thermal Analysis**: Detect heat signatures indicating stress or infection
5. **Severity Assessment**: Calculate percentage of affected area and spot count
6. **Smart Recommendation**: Suggest precise pesticide type, quantity, and spray pressure
